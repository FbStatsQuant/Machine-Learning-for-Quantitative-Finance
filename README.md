# Machine-Learning-for-Quantitative-Finance
This repository provides an overview of various Machine Learning algorithms and models, and specific implementations for financial modeling.

Specifically, you will find:

1. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR): An application to the CAPM model, and its Famma-French enxtension.
2. Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net: One of the main limitations of MLR is that it may yield estimates with high variance, which could be an useful alternative when some of the features are highly correlated. 
3. Logistic Regression:

This repository provides an overview of various Machine Learning algorithms and models, along with a concise mathematical analysis and specific implementations for financial modeling.

Specifically, you will find:

1. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR): General model, assumptions, how to verify them and want to do if they are not satisfied. Also, an application to the CAPM model.
2. Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net: One of the main limitations of MLR is that it may yield estimates with high variance, which could be an useful alternative when some of the features are highly correlated. In the Bayesian Modeling respository we offer the equivalent bayesian derivation of the Lasso and Ridge models.

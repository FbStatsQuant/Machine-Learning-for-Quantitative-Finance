# Machine-Learning-for-Quantitative-Finance
This repository provides an overview of various Machine Learning algorithms and models, and specific implementations for financial modeling.

Specifically, you will find:

1. Multiple Linear Regression: An application to the CAPM model, and its Famma-French enxtension.
2. Logistic Regression and Suppor Vector Machine: Application to Market Regime, in which I identify whether the market is at a bearish or bullish state as a function of market and macroeconomic variables.
3. Multiple classification algorithms such us SVM, random forest and stochastic gradient.
4. Cultering algorithms, such as K Means, applied to the stocks.
